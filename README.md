# Hi, I’m Andreas Frick Toresand
## Frontend Developer
I have a problem-solving mindset and I see challenges as an opportunity to grow and learn. I love coding because it is always evolving, it expands the mind and it reminds me that there are often many ways to solve a problem. I enjoy teamwork and agile work methods. As a person I am social, easygoing, and curious.
